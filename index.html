      <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">It is a super earth! Meaning it is like Earth but it is bigger or massive!</h5>
      <p class="text-muted">Kepler-452b (a planet sometimes quoted to be an Earth 2.0 or Earth's Cousin based on its characteristics; also known by its Kepler Object of Interest designation KOI-7016.01) is a super-Earth exoplanet orbiting within the inner edge of the habitable zone of the sunlike star Kepler-452 and is the only planet in the system discovered by Kepler. It is located about 1,800 light-years (550 pc) from Earth in the constellation of Cygnus.

        Kepler-452b orbits its star at a distance of 1.04 AU (156 million km; 97 million mi) from its host star (nearly the same distance as Earth from the Sun), with an orbital period of roughly 384 days, has a mass at least five times that of Earth, and has a radius of around 1.5 times that of Earth. It is the first potentially rocky super-Earth planet discovered orbiting within the habitable zone of a very sunlike star. However, it is unknown if it is entirely habitable, as it is receiving slightly more energy than Earth and could be subjected to a runaway greenhouse effect.
        
        The Kepler space telescope identified the exoplanet, and its discovery was announced by NASA on 23 July 2015. The planet is about 1,800 light-years (550 pc) away from the Solar System. At the speed of the New Horizons spacecraft, at about 59,000 km/h (16,000 m/s; 37,000 mph), it would take approximately 30 million years to get there.</p>

      <hr>
      <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">It is the closest known exoplanet neighbor to Earth! It is only 4-light years away!</h5>
      <p class="text-muted">Proxima Centauri b (or Proxima b) is the closest, potentially habitable exoplanet to Earth. It is orbiting in the habitable zone of the red dwarf star Proxima Centauri, which is the closest star to the Sun and part of the triple star system Alpha Centauri. It is approximately 4.2 ly (1.3 pc) from Earth in the constellation Centaurus, making it, Proxima c, and Proxima d the closest known exoplanets to the Solar System.

        Proxima Centauri b orbits its star at a distance of roughly 0.05 AU (7.5 million km; 4.6 million mi) with an orbital period of approximately 11.2 Earth days. Its other properties are only poorly understood, but it is believed to be a possibly Earth-like planet with minimum mass of 1.07 MðŸœ¨. The planet orbits within the habitable zone of its star. It is, however, not known whether or not it has an atmosphere. Proxima Centauri is a flare star with intense emission of electromagnetic radiation that could rip an atmosphere off the planet. The planet's proximity to Earth offers an opportunity for robotic space exploration, for example, with the Breakthrough Starshot project.</p>
